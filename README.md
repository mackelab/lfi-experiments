# Experiments with likelihood-free inference

Applications of likelihood-free inference to different problems. 

Formerly, this repository was called `likelihoodfree-models`. See https://github.com/mackelab/lfi-experiments/tree/170523_nips for a snapshot of this repo at the time of NIPS submission. Those models and summary statistics will slowly be integrated into `lfimodels` and `delfi`.
