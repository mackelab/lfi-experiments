# Experiments with likelihood-free inference

Experiments that apply likelihood-free inference to different problems. 

This repository relies on the packages `delfi` and `lfimodels`. `delfi` contains
code for density-estimation likelihood-free inference. `lfimodels` contains
(mostly) neuroscience-related simulator models and summary statistics that can
be used with `delfi`. Some toy statistical models are directly part of `delfi`.

This repository contains per-experiment subfolders. Common files are in the
root directory.

Formerly, this repository was called `likelihoodfree-models`. See https://github.com/mackelab/lfi-experiments/tree/170523_nips for a snapshot of this repo at the time of NIPS submission. Those models and summary statistics will slowly be integrated into `lfimodels` and `delfi`.
