# likelihood-free inference experiments

Applications of likelihood-free inference to different problems. 

Models and summary statistics in this codebase will slowly be integrated with `lfimodels` and `delfi`. Formerly, this repository was called `likelihoodfree-models`. See https://github.com/mackelab/lfi-experiments/tree/170523_nips for a snapshot of this repo at the time of NIPS submission.
