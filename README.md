# Experiments with likelihood-free inference

Experiments that apply likelihood-free inference to different problems. 

This repository contains per-experiment subfolders. Common files are in the root directory.


## Requirements

This repository relies on the packages `delfi` and `lfimodels`:
- `delfi` contains code for density-estimation likelihood-free inference and
  toy statistical models
- `lfimodels` contains neuroscience-related models and summary statistics that can be used with `delfi`


## Note

Formerly, this repository was called `likelihoodfree-models`. See https://github.com/mackelab/lfi-experiments/tree/170523_nips for a snapshot of this repo at the time of NIPS submission. Those models and summary statistics will slowly be integrated into `lfimodels` and `delfi`.
