# Experiments with Arco's multicompartment cell

Experiments that apply likelihood-free inference to Arco's multicompartment cell. 


## Requirements

This code relies on the packages `delfi` and `in_silico_framework`:
- `delfi` contains code for density-estimation likelihood-free inference and
  toy statistical models
- `in_silico_framework` contains Arco's multicompartment model ([Arco's repository](https://github.com/abast/in_silico_framework))
